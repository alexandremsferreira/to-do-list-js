# To-Do List 📝

This is a simple To-Do List project developed with Vanilla JavaScript. The goal of this project is to practice and apply important web development concepts, such as DOM manipulation and user events.

## Features ✨

- **Add Tasks**: The user can add new tasks to the list by entering a description and clicking the "Add" button ➕.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Each task has a checkbox that allows the user to mark the task as completed, changing the visual style of the task ✅.
- **Remove Tasks**: The user can remove tasks from the list. If the task is not completed, the user will be prompted for confirmation before deleting ❌.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **HTML**: To structure the page layout.
- **CSS**: To style the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For interaction logic and DOM manipulation.

## Learnings 📚

During the development of this project, I learned how to:

- Manipulate the DOM to dynamically create, edit, and remove elements.
- Work with events in JavaScript (such as `click`, `change`, and `keypress`).
- Organize the code in a modular and clean way, separating features into reusable functions.

This project was a great opportunity to practice and improve my JavaScript skills, as well as deepen my understanding of how to build simple and functional applications using only Vanilla JavaScript.
